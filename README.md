# News Application

## Project description
Create a news application with next features:
* All news
* Top headers
* Saved news

I've used libraries like: 
* Snapkit 
* Alamofire

Snapkit for autolayout and Alamofire for parsing JSON data from API


The original saved data was saved to the local memory when there is no internet connection. And when the Internet connection appears, we will continue to download the data. In this case, I saved in User Defaults.

Implemented the favorites tab, where it can store the data we need. Of course, there is also a function where you can delete data from the favorites tab.
